  "the superabsorbent and lint-free world of geometric algebra (and on into
   geo'tric calculus)")

;;
;; The approach we'll use here is protocol-rich... or -heavy, depending
;; on your taste. But in general we wish to represent elements in GA
;; at a few natural levels: weighted basis blades ('Bladoid');
;; collections of a number of Bladoids of uniform grade ('Gradeling'),
;; sorted lexicographically on basis; collections of Gradelings of
;; heterogeneous grade ('MV', for multivector), sorted on grade; and
;; vector itself ('Vect'). In addition, for the moment we have a special
;; class to represent the zero element ('ZeroElement'), which is identical
;; for all grades. These different representations (or GA elements) are
;; called here in the source file 'rungs'.
;;
;; The protocol immediately following is the (presently malnourished but
;; still growing) set of canonical operations applicable to each of the
;; aforenamed elements. It might be argued that the final protocol in
;; this section ('IScamperUpAndDownLadder') could reasonably be merged
;; with the basic protocol ('IHestenic'), but from the current insomniac
;; perspective it seems cognitively useful to keep 'em separate.
;;
;; Note that we extend many of these protocols too to java.lang.Number
;; to enjoy automatic interop of existing numeric types with the GA
;; system. Thanks, lisp dialect!
;;
;; This implementation is knowably inefficient, and that to a ridiculous
;; degree; but it intends to articulate via code the mechanics of GA
;; calculations in a clean and efficient way. We assume that this one
;; will be followed by a far more parsimonious implementation.
;;
;; Note, more pleasingly, that the implementation is effectively
;; dimension-independent. None of the representations requires or
;; indeed expresses any particular dimension -- if you wedge e0 and
;; e1 and e2, then you're "in" three dimensions; but if you then
;; wedge that with e4, well, you're in 5D. There are of course
;; operations that require asserting a dimension: at the moment,
;; only the pseudoscalar (and derived bits, like dualization) takes
;; a 'dim' argument.
